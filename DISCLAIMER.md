# Disclaimer

This project is in no way associated, sponsored, development, maintained, owned, supported, or otherwise affiliated with GitHub.

The official GitHub GraphQL API v4 is located at https://developer.github.com/v4/.

This disclaimer has been added as a direct response to GitHub's support staff asking for the name to be changed of the project due to it possibly confusing people as an official project of GitHub.

# Our Position

In our opinion this is a ridiculous request as according to their logic it would imply that _GitHub GraphQL CLI_ is both an official project of GitHub _and_ GraphQL - which is not the case, nor has it ever been suggested or even considered.

# GitHub Request Thread

To make sure there is no misunderstanding by the open source community of this project being an open source project, in any way associated with GitHub the company, here is the exchange between GitHub and StepWeb:

```
Hi Milan,

Lee from GitHub here. Thank you for using GitHub, creating the GraphQL CLI project, and using the GitHub Community Forum to reach out for other contributors. It's great to see this kind of interest in innovation and collaboration around GitHub itself. We have recently noticed, however, that you are using GitHub's name in your project named "GitHub GraphQL CLI" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-graphql-cli) in such a way that might be confusing to people using or contributing to your project. This is a friendly request to ask you to make some simple changes to your application and listing to stop any potential confusion.

As I'm sure you can appreciate, GitHub relies on its trademarks (such as its name and logos) to signal to the public that products or services are "officially" made or authorized by GitHub. At the same time, we value the contributions made by our awesome community of users, and we recognize that users may want to use GitHub's name and logos to talk about GitHub, link back to GitHub, or promote tools that are built with or integrated with GitHub — all of which we enthusiastically support. In order to encourage these uses among the GitHub community, we make our logos available for download and provide guidelines on the proper ways to use them to strike the appropriate balance between these competing concerns. (See https://github.com/logos)

In this case, your use of the "GitHub" name is potentially confusing because it is presented as the name for your tool — at least on the listing in the Node package repository. In particular, the project name, "GitHub GraphQL CLI", makes the application sound as though it is sponsored by, endorsed by, or an official project of GitHub. Rather than use "GitHub" as an adjective, you may refer to GitHub in a relational phrase. For example, you could say that the project is "compatible with" or "for use with" GitHub or something along those lines. Once you have made the changes, kindly respond to let us know.

Please let us know if you have any questions. You may also refer to our logo usage guidelines (https://github.com/logos) for further guidance. Thanks in advance for your understanding.

Cheers,

Lee Dohm

Hi Lee,

Thank you for your message.  I will add a disclaimer with a copy of your message to the project to make it absolutely clear to everyone that this project is in no way related to GitHub.  This will be released in the next version.

Thanks,
Milan

Hi Milan,

Thanks for the quick response. While we appreciate you being willing to add a disclaimer that this is not an official GitHub project, we do not think that is sufficient to prevent user confusion. Even with a disclaimer, having "GitHub" at the beginning of the name of the tool and "github" at the beginning of the package name is a confusing use of the GitHub name. Because of this we would ask that you remove "GitHub" from the beginning of the name of the tool and package name. As we stated before, you can still use "GitHub" in a relational way such as "for GitHub" or "compatible with GitHub".

I hope this clarifies things.

Thanks again,

Lee

Hi Lee,

We disagree with your assumption.  There are plenty of projects on npm beginning with `github` that in no way imply GitHub's sponsorship or ownership of it.  The name describes the tool's intended application.

Nowhere to we make any direct or indirect suggestions that this project is an official GitHub project.  However, in the unlikely event of even the slightest confusion, which we completely disagree with even being possible, as we've stated before a disclaimer will be sufficient to remove any suggested confusion and will be added in the next version update.

The name will not be changed.

Thanks,
Milan
